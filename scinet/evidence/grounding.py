- Every item must be atomic, self-contained, and independently understandable.
- Do not use vague references such as "the framework", "this method", "the proposed approach", or "this component" unless the referent is explicitly named in the same sentence.
- Do not use undefined acronyms or paper-internal shorthand without explanation.
- Stay faithful to the input. Do not invent details, datasets, baselines, metrics, claims, or terminology.
- Different items should not be near-duplicates.
- `basic_idea` should summarize the core innovation, task, and key mechanism.
- `motivation` should contain concrete limitations, gaps, or needs only when present.
- `method` should be the main focus and should break the approach into atomic components such as overall framework, component role, implementation detail, component interaction, training objective, or inference procedure.
- `experimental_focus` must come after `method` conceptually and explain what each experiment is meant to validate, test, resolve, or demonstrate.
- To write `experimental_focus`, combine the experimental part of the input with the earlier `motivation` and `method`.
- Focus on the purpose of the experiment only: what research problem it is addressing, what claim/mechanism it is trying to validate, what comparison or analysis is meant to establish, or what question it is intended to answer.
- Write each `experimental_focus` item as the underlying experimental goal, not as the path used to reach that goal.
- Remove phrasing such as "use/apply/through/by ... to validate/evaluate/test ..." and rewrite it as the goal itself.
- Different experimental paths that serve the same validation purpose should be normalized into the same goal-level focus whenever possible.
- Do not focus on the technical setup itself. Avoid datasets, baselines, metrics, hardware, split names, implementation details, procedural descriptions, or named evaluation protocols unless they are strictly necessary to state the experimental goal.
- Do not focus on outcome statements. Avoid result phrasing such as "outperforms baselines", "achieves better performance", or "aligns with human experts".
- If the source mentions setup, procedure, or outcomes but the underlying purpose is clear, rewrite the item as that purpose only.
- If a section is absent, return an empty array for that section.
